    <p> 
        The Cliffs of Moher (/ˈmʌhər/; Irish: Aillte an Mhothair) are dramatic sea cliffs located at the southwestern edge of the Burren region in County Clare, Ireland. Spanning approximately 14 kilometers (9 miles), the cliffs rise to 120 meters (390 feet) above the Atlantic Ocean at Hag's Head on their southern end. Eight kilometers (5 miles) to the north, they reach their highest point of 214 meters (702 feet) just north of O'Brien's Tower, a round stone tower built in 1835 by Sir Cornelius O'Brien. From there, the cliffs continue at lower elevations. The nearest villages are Liscannor, 6 kilometers (4 miles) to the south, and Doolin, 7 kilometers (4 miles) to the north.
        <br> <br>
        Visitors to the cliffs, and those atop O'Brien's Tower, can enjoy views of the Aran Islands in Galway Bay, the Maumturks and Twelve Pins mountain ranges to the north in County Galway, and Loop Head to the south. The Cliffs of Moher are among Ireland's most popular tourist destinations, attracting around 1.5 million visitors annually.

        <h2>My Little Trek</h2>
        <p>When we arrived to the cliffs, we got brunch at the park cafe. I got the salmon foccaccia, and it was delish. Then I went on a little solo walk up and down the path. This is certainly a must-see, however I will say that the amount of other tourists there hampered the experience a bit. The paths were quite crowded, and I simply enjoy nature more when alone.
