        <h3>Bus Tour in Dublin</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024</time>
        <p> We started our afternoon with a bus tour to see historical sights around Dublin. We had a lovely tour guide named who took us to our first stop: Phoenix Park. This is a lovely, large, green area, supposedly the largest park in Europe. This is where the president of Ireland lives. We saw their house, which the White House is modeled after. We then went to the city center to see the famous postal office and big spire. This part of town was much busier than other parts I'd been too. We ended our tour at the Dublin Castle, which is a small castle-like building where the English soilders used to be housed in.</p> <br>

        <p>Yesterday, after class, we went to <span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Stephens park and walked around Grafton Street. I had been wondering where there main shopping district was, and it seems that this was that place! We had a nice time wondering through shops and coffee houses, then made our way to the park. At Ulysses Rare Books, I got a book of poetry called The Sound of Silence, as well as a pocket-guide for The Portrait of Dorian Grey. This is my favorite shop I've been to so far! Much antiquated literature to peruse. We also went to an Italian coffee spot where I got a mint, lemon San Pelligrino, which I sipped in the park.

        <h3>Coffee and Ireland</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-10">May 10, 2024</time>
        <p>Black, drip coffee does not seem to exist in Ireland. In the hotel we are staying in, the coffee maker is a small espresso machine with pods provided. Downstairs, again, it is a machine for espresso, lattes, and americanos. I spoke with a barista at Rumi coffee on Francis St, and she told me that the closest coffee to drip coffee that one will often find in Dublin is probably the americano. This is a disappointment to me and a personal attack on my morning routine. Though there are many things about Ireland I love, coffee is not one of them currently. However, in the spirit of good graces in travel, I will let this one offense go.

        <h3>Wicklow Clouds</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-14">May 14, 2024</time>
        <p>Today we were on the tram from Central Park (leaving Microsoft headquarters) to the St. Stephen’s Park stop. A few stops before our arrival at St. Stephen’s, however, the train stopped. They let us know that the power was down on the whole green line, the green line being our plan to get home. The disgruntled Irish people leaving the tram indicated that it would not be worth it to “wait it out”. So, we walked! Though I’ve led with this story of inconvenience and breakage, I’m actually here to write about how I’ve found the public transport system in and around Ireland to be designed rather well. Coming from America where we have largely poor public transportation, Dublin’s transport is a welcome opportunity for travel. I have what is called a “LeapCard”, which is used for getting on the buses, tram, and DART (train). I can add money on it using an app or using a kiosk at many stations around the city. In NY, you can pay for the subway using apple pay, so I do wonder what their reasoning for not having that capability would be. <br><br> Below are some links to poems where their authors reflect on these Irish cloudscapes: </p>

        <h3>Dublin Public Transport</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-15">May 15, 2024</time>
        <p>We went to Wicklow yesterday to hike, and I took great interest in the clouds. They are grand and billowing and come in and out swiftly. They seem to often be closer to the ground than I am accustomed to. This was dramaticized because of the higher elevation of the mountain we hiked, but they still seemed unusually close. It is great fun to play with perspectives in photographs at these higher elevations because you can make it look as though the clouds are touching the grass someone or some sheep stands on.

        <h3>The Beautiful and Well-Trained Dogs of Dublin</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 19, 2024</time>
        <p>The dogs here are angelic and beautiful. I thought this was just a result of witnessing the dogs in an affluent part of Ireland, but I've seen this trend everywhere in Ireland we have gone. Half of the dogs we see are not on leashes and can simply follow their owners around the city or scenic path. It's wild. I love it and want one. Below is a picture of a dog at the Cliffs
