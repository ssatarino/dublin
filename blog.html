        <h3>Bus Tour in Dublin</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024</time>
        <p> We started our afternoon with a bus tour to see historical sights around Dublin. We had a lovely tour guide named who took us to our first stop: Phoenix Park. This is a lovely, large, green area, supposedly the largest park in Europe. This is where the president of Ireland lives. We saw their house, which the White House is modeled after. We then went to the city center to see the famous postal office and big spire. This part of town was much busier than other parts I'd been too. We ended our tour at the Dublin Castle, which is a small castle-like building where the English soilders used to be housed in.</p>

        <h3>St. Stephen's Park and Grafton Street</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 8, 2024</time>
        <p>Yesterday, after class, we went to St. Stephens park and walked around Grafton Street. I had been wondering where there main shopping district was, and it seems that this was that place! We had a nice time wondering through shops and coffee houses, then made our way to the park. At Ulysses, I got a book of poetry called The Sound of Silence, as well as a pocket-guide for The Portrait of Dorian Grey. This is my favorite shop I've been to so far! Much antiquated literature to peruse. We also went to an Italian coffee spot where I got a mint, lemon San Pelligrino, which I sipped in the park.</p>
